A pretty cool hotword-activated home automation system, like a poor man's Alexa.

Features:
  - ok-ish plugin system with some plugins
  - it can tell you how tall Obama is
  - it can control Google Play Music Desktop Player on a local or remote machine

How to use it: Just install dependancies with `yarn` or `npm install`, then `node index.js`

Then say "panda" to your computer, followed by a command like "How old is Obama's dog"
